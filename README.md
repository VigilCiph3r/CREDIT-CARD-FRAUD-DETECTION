Credit card fraud is a significant issue worldwide, affecting millions of people each year. In the United States alone, where the majority of the population owns credit cards, fraud is widespread. The problem is not limited to the US; countries like Brazil also face substantial fraud rates, with millions falling victim to credit card fraud annually.

In this project, we aim to tackle fraud detection using a dataset from Kaggle. This dataset comprises credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. Over this two-day period, there were 492 instances of fraud out of a total of 284,807 transactions. This dataset is highly unbalanced, as fraudulent transactions make up only a tiny fraction (0.17%) of the total. The dataset consists mainly of numerical features resulting from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation, with only the 'Time' and 'Amount' features remaining unchanged. The 'Class' feature indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

Our project's objective is to develop machine learning models capable of accurately identifying credit card fraud based on this data. We will compare the performance of different models using one method to balance the dataset. Through these steps, we aim to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various models in detecting credit card fraud.
